# ChatGPT Tetris

This repository was inspired by the [ChatGPT Minesweeper](https://github.com/sorrge/ChatGPT_production) game created by [sorrge](https://github.com/sorrge).\
It was created by giving ChatGPT prompts to implement features in this game, with some help from myself when ChatGPT was confused.
